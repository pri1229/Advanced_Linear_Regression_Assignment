# House Price Prediction
- A US-based housing company named Surprise Housing has decided to enter the Australian market. The company uses data analytics to purchase houses at a price below their actual values and flip them on at a higher price. For the same purpose, the company has collected a data set from the sale of houses in Australia. The data is provided in the CSV file below.

- The company is looking at prospective properties to buy to enter the market. You are required to build a regression model using regularisation in order to predict the actual value of the prospective properties and decide whether to invest in them or not.

## General Information
- Thie House Price Prediction Assignment is solved to practice and apply Advanced Linear Regression algorithm (using regularization) as part of the machine learning program.
- We are trying to understand what are the variables important in predicting the price of house
- The business problem that we are trying to solve here helping them give a model which they can leverage and adapt to new strategies that would help them to increase there revenue
- The dataset being used is train.csv
